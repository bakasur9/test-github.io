Getting started with Skincare can be overwhelming, what ingredients do what, what all are safe, what all are soothing, in what order should they be layered, at what frequency are they supposed to be used. Basically, there are too many questions, too much stuff to learn, and too little experience. <!--more--> So, I’ll tell you all about the things I’ve learned during the last 10+ months and if you can avoid the mistakes I’ve done, this article would have served its purpose, and can rest in peace.

A little disclaimer: while I’d like to think of myself as a person that does quite decent research no matter what the subject, I’d like you to take my advice with a pinch of salt. Do your own research thoroughly before you add a product into your routine.

So, since this is a dummies guide I’ll try and help you make a routine for yourself. I’ll add my advice at the end, based on experience and I hope this would be your greater take away as the rest info can be found anywhere online. And by no means do I mean you guys are dummies btw.

Firstly, let’s address why skincare? As much as we’d like our life to be a perfect bubble, we know that it isn’t the case. Skincare can help every single type of skin. Your skin breaks out? Sure, we can do something about it, you get dry patches on your skin? Sure, we can manage that too, you have no problem with skin whatsoever? We can help your skin be that way till your friends are all old and wrinkly. The idea of skincare is just to provide what it needs for it to remain in a zen state by keeping it happy.

Your skin can just do fine with as basic a routine as Cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen. Rest all is needed for that extra push if you will. Skin, as fascinating and self-sufficient a thing it is, sometimes needs help to function properly.

Let’s tackle this baffling thing that skincare is by focusing on one product at a time.

I loved this paragraph that has been put together by AsainBeauty on Reddit.

Understanding what works for you and making informed purchases are a bit of a chicken-and-egg conundrum seeing as you won’t know your skin until you start using a routine, and you won’t know what to purchase until you know your skin! That being said, there are a lot of products out there that work for the majority of people and maybe safe initial purchases, based on your skin type and skin concerns. There may be a perfect product out there for you, but it may take some time to find it as you will have to figure out what specific ingredients your skin likes, which ones it can’t deal with, and which ones are just meh.

Cleanser
We all know that our face similar to our body needs washing too. So, whenever you’re choosing a cleanser make sure it is as gentle as it can be. It shouldn’t be over stripping no matter what. If you have a squeaky clean face after you wash your face and you feel like “ oh my face seems to be pretty clean now, in your face dirt and bacteria ha!, I won’t let you become a zit on my face today” then you’re in trouble.

As we know our skin, being an intelligent thing that it is, normally produces oil for preserving itself. But when your face is over cleansed, if that’s a word, your skin rings the emergency alarm and asks for more oil production. So now you might feel like your face is greasy all day long. If you’re a dry-skinned person then guess what you’re in for more trouble. So, it’s important to choose something that doesn’t strip away your natural oils. I’d advise staying away from the whole anti-acne facewash lines we have, as none of them actually benefit you. Your facewashes should have a pH between 4.5 to 7. pH of products is important for maintaining skin barrier integrity, your skin has an acid mantle (protective barrier on the surface of skin composed of sweat, skin oils, and dead skin cells) that gives it its pH value. This mantle is a thin layer on your skin that protects you from bacteria, viruses, fungi making it soft and supple, disrupting this layer can cause effects like inflammation, dermatitis, dry and dehydrated skin. Pollution, pathogens, cleansers, soaps and even water might disrupt your mantle, so it’s important for your cleanser to have a low pH so that it doesn’t make your skin “squeaky” clean. I know I just complicated the shit out for something like a cleanser, but don’t worry you’ll find a ton of recommendations for cleansers in that pH range.

And 60 seconds should be the max time you should spend washing your face.

Your typical face cleansers are actually used as a second cleanser. There is actually an oil-based cleanser that people use to remove the dirt, make-up, pollution, sunscreen at the end of the day. You can’t actually use oil for this purpose as there’s a risk of it remaining on the skin, even after the second cleanse, and therefore clogging your pores. Oil Cleansers or micellar water or cleansing balms are the better choices for first cleansing as they have emulsifiers that break down the oil and therefore help you remove dirt and makeup along with oil. You might actually be fine without incorporating the first cleanser but many people often report that it actually made a difference, helping them.

You can skip cleansers in the morning and it might actually benefit you, remember how we talked about stripping your face of Its natural oils.

Some loved and affordable products: Cetaphil Gentle cleanser, Simple refreshing Facewash.

Moisturizer
This is just more of a trial and error sort of thing. Just choosing a moisturizer with non-comedogenic ingredients (pore-clogging ingredients) would be fine. Oily skinned people can like gel textured moisturizers, dry skinned people can benefit from something thick. Typically, the thicker the product, the more moisturizing it is. If you’re oily I’d advise you to stay away from all-natural moisturizers as they usually have too many oils in them and they might clog your pores and you might end up with closed comedones (or clogged pores). There are three things in moisturizers emollients, occlusives, humectants. Emollients provide your skin with required moisturization helping your lipid barrier (your skin has lipids and ceramides and all kinds of stuff) therefore keeping it healthy, Oils, shea butter, ceramides are examples of emollients you can find. Humectants bring moisture to your skin from the air thus preventing your skin from getting dry, Glycerin and hyaluronic acid are the two main used Humectants. Occlusives prevent water loss from your skin, oils, silicones, dimethicone, mineral oils are examples of occlusives you can usually find in products. These three in a moisturizer can help your skin restore its skin barrier therefore keeping it healthy and happy while minimizing the possibility for irritation.

Things to consider when evaluating how well your moisturizer works:

Does it leave your skin feeling bouncy and supple? Happy and healthy, not dry and tight, is what a good moisturizer is aiming for.
How long does that moisturized feeling last? If it only lasts an hour or two, you may want to find a different moisturizer! Perhaps try a thicker moisturizer, like a cream or a balm.
If your moisturizer is gentle enough, doesn’t break you out, and does what it’s supposed to do, that’s awesome! Go ahead and enjoy it as part of your skincare routine :). If it turns out that your product irritates your skin, breaks you out, or doesn’t do what it's supposed to, it might be time to try a different one!

Sunscreen:
It’s the most important step, period. Whatever you might be doing to your skin, if you aren’t using sunscreen it would all be a waste.

Sunscreen has the following benefits:

Reduces the risk of skin cancer
Prevents hyperpigmentation
Reduces signs of aging
Protects against signs of photodamage (fine lines, etc.)
Prevents burns (dark-skinned people aren’t affected much)
Things to remember before buying sunscreen:

1. The more the SPF the better it is.

2. It should be waterproof

3. It shouldn’t break you out (obviously)

4. I’d advise you to stay away from the whole natural line again.

5. If you have dark skin, avoid sunscreens with high percentages of physical filters (zinc oxide and titanium dioxide) as they’ll lend a white cast to your skin. Chemical sunscreens are your best bet.

6. If you have sensitive skin, you may prefer to look for an all physical sunscreen or a physical/chemical combination sunscreen — chemical filters (Oxybenzone, Avobenzone, typically organic ingredients) may cause stinging and irritation for some people.

Korean Sunscreens (from CosRx and Purito perhaps) are great, they tend to be moisturizing while providing an adequate amount of sun protection

This is it for people that usually have healthy skin or normal skin, from here on you can make your skin better but you’d have to be careful with giving your skin that extra push for dealing with aging, pigmentation, scarring, etc. I’m all up for it, if I can better myself in any way possible, and achieving great things always involves a tad bit of risk as you’d be treading in unfamiliar territory. You can minimalize the risk by studying more about it and all things worth having require effort now, don’t they? I’m just making it sound dramatic because I messed up and I don’t want you to mess up.

After following a basic routine for a few months and building a healthy skin barrier, you can start adding actives to your routine that benefit you and up your skincare game a notch. But do not enter the actives zone unless you’ve found a good Cleanser, moisturizer, and Sunscreen routine. After nailing your basic routine wait a month or two before introducing a new product and introduce a single product at a time. Be patient skincare takes time to show any results.

Let’s talk actives now.
AHAs: Alpha hydroxy acids or it is called, are exfoliating agents that work on surface-level helping you clear out tiny bumps on your skin (CCs). AHAs brighten your skin too helping with hyperpigmentation as they work on the surface level. Even though using acids on your skin sounds terrifying, don’t worry they are well-researched ingredients and do wonders for your skin. Glycolic acid, Lactic acid (Milder), Mandelic acid (Milder) are commonly found ingredients.

BHAs: BHAs are oil-soluble ingredients so they work at the pore level. The soak up the oil clogging the pore that was about to become a pimple. These help people with acne a lot. Salicylic acid, betaine salicylate (Milder) are commonly found ingredients.

PHAs: PHAs are really mild ingredients and can be very well treated by people with sensitive skin.

All these ingredients are exfoliating ingredients that are naturally derived (from almonds, sugarcane, beets, etc;) and can be found in various formulations and products like toners, essence, moisturizers, sometimes cleansers (but these make very little difference as they don’t sit on your face longer). Start with the smallest percentage you can find and start introducing it once a week. No matter what the product says, don’t start anything with the recommended usage. Start bringing it into your routine by using it once a week for a month or so and then increase it to twice a week. You can really irritate your skin if you aren’t careful enough. Be patient, they’ll help you.

Over exfoliation: This is a thing and if you happen to do this, that is exfoliate more than you are supposed to, your skin is going to freak the F out. You’ll damage your skin barrier, deal with more breakouts, your skin will remain red for long periods of time so don’t overuse a product that you have never used before. (I’ve had to deal with this btw)

Niacinamide: This is an active form of vitamin B3 that helps with pigmentation, sebum production and therefore reducing the size of your pores. This ingredient is really well tolerated by everyone and often is referred to as a holy grail ingredient.

Now the I haven’t had experience with ingredients like vitamin C, Retinoids, Azelaic acid, and others yet and so I can’t speak from personal experience but research them thoroughly if you’d want t get into them. They can make your situation worse if you don’t use them carefully. Since I’m a dummy too I’d want to stay away from them for now.

Purging: Also learn about purging. Whenever you’re introducing any actives your skin becomes worse before it gets better (worse as in you’ll deal with more than you usually do, so it changes from person to person). Purging is only possible if you are using products with active exfoliants, such as AHAs, BHAs, scrubs, peels, or retinoids. Why? Because exfoliation causes your skin to push the blockages inside of it out to the surface. Therefore, you can’t really “purge” from using a new moisturizer or new sunscreen. If you feel like you are “purging” after using a new moisturizer (or new product without any actives), you are probably just breaking out from the product. This usually lasts for a few weeks.

Also, here’s a guide on adding products I found recently that might help you.

Skin Concerns
First knowing what skin type you have, helps a lot. Go through this video and then you can understand what might help your skin.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vic-EMOivpA

Let’s get through skin concerns now and let’s begin with the most common issue “Acne”.

Oily skin people usually have to deal with acne compared to dry skin people. The frustrating thing about acne is there isn’t a single thing you can point out to be the potential cause. There are literally a ton of factors that can trigger acne. So, first, let’s understand why you breakout.

Our skin is made up of pores right and these pores usually have hair follicles, and there are sebaceous glands in these pores that produce oil to nourish your skin and the follicle. But we being humans we shed skin cells quite often and this is called skin cell turnover (about 50% of the dust around you comprises dead skin cells). Sometimes when too much oil is produced or too many dead skin cells are shed our pores usually make a cocktail of oil and dead skin cells blocking our pores and these are clogged pores. There’s this bacteria called p.acne that enters this cocktail sometimes to party, and when our body detects this invasion it sends white blood cells to fight them off and it becomes this pus-filled pimple. Lack of sleep, stress, hormones, food, etc. can also trigger acne from the inside messing up the oil production and skin cell turnover.

Regulating Sebum Production:

1. Look out for ingredients like Niacinamide, green tea.

2. Moisturize your skin so your skin doesn’t have to.

3. Use a cleanser that isn’t over stripping.

4. Include facial oils to lock in the moisture, it really can be a game-changer. Look out for oils with high linoleic acid like Rosehip oil or squalene as they are light on the skin. (oils high in oleic acid can help dry skin by providing sufficient nourishment as they tend to be rich).

Managing dead skin:

Exfoliants: Exfoliation is the way to help our skin with managing its skin cell turnover. You might be familiar with scrubs we usually find in the market. Scrubs are labeled under physical exfoliation. Even though people have been using physical exfoliation for a long time, it is actually proven to be not skin-friendly. The grains in scrubs usually cause micro-tears in your skin and might aggravate aging. Also, avoid scrubs if you have breakouts on your face, or maybe just avoid the region you have the breakout. If it’s cut open it might lead to further inflammation, pigmentation and makes you more susceptible to have another breakout. If you are choosing physical exfoliation make sure the grains are as tiny as possible. I actually find chemical exfoliators beneficial and safe. About which I’ve added in the Actives section.

Pigmentation:

There are two types of Pigmentation. One is PIE the other is PIH. PIE is the red spot you usually have after the pimple situation. It is usually red as capillaries below the skin are damaged. If you further irritate your skin or expose it to sunlight your skin triggers melanocytes to produce more melanin to save keratinocytes, therefore resulting in PIH. This is the dark spot that you see after the pimple situation.

Pigmentation takes months to heal so your best bet is to prevent it from happening. So, what can you do to prevent it? Firstly, stop picking at your pimples. It just irritates your skin and more irritation equals more damage which equals more recovery time. Don’t go under sunlight if you don’t have sunscreen on. It is generally advised to wear sunscreen even though you are indoors. If you don’t wear sunscreen with enough SPF, there’s no point in doing any sort of treatment for those spots. It would all just be a moo point. So, wear sunscreen kids.

For reduction of pigmentation, you can add niacinamide, AHAs, Vitamin C, azelaic acid to your routine. But sunscreen first.

Dry skinned beauties: Dry skinned people are usually more susceptible to aging so, it’s really important to hydrate and moisturize your skin. You can add ingredients like Hyaluronic acid, glycerin, and choose moisturizers that are usually thick in consistency. Also, add toners and essences for hydration. You can also look up slugging online. Follow Charlotte Palermino on Instagram for advice.

Advice from experience
I had to learn these things the hard way as I f’d up way too much and I literally gambled with my skin, which I strongly advise you shouldn’t btw. I was just an idiot honestly, hope you take away these things.

1. Asian beauty over everything: This is just a personal preference actually as they usually tend to be really really mild and beginner-friendly.

2. Keep your skin happy. Do not irritate it no matter what. If you find that something is irritating your skin dump it no matter how much you’ve paid for it or just use it on your body. Also, keep your routine really simple. The more products you add the more you are susceptible to irritation and the less you’ll know what might have caused it.

3. Don’t underestimate the damage products can do. Introduce any sort of product with caution, always stay on the back foot. Introduce anything in small amounts. You don’t need a ton of ingredients and products to have healthy skin, keep it simple, and only introduce products according to needs.

4. Always always always start with the least potent product you can find, to help your skin get used to it.

5. No essential oils. Essential oils do more bad than good usually. They might trigger serious irritation, speed up aging. No tea tree oil topical application and all, trust me on this. There were way better ingredients out there that you can experiment with.

6. No fragrance can be the way to go if you can find it. Usually, companies don’t disclose the ingredients they’ve used for fragrance and so some ingredient present in there might trigger irritation.

7. If you find a red spot you see before the pimple pops up, it usually means something irritated your skin and now it is Inflamed. Spot treating it with pure aloe vera gel helps a ton. You can try wow 99% aloe gel (the only product I trust enough from wow btw).

8. STOP TOUCHING YOUR FACE.

9. Pimple popping isn’t worth the shit you have to deal with later at all.

10. Give your product some time. Sometimes it might not be the product that irritated your skin so don’t jump on that trigger quick.

11. No product is going to change your skin overnight, there is no miracle product out there. So, stop being impatient and using it more than you can handle. There is nothing called overnight transformation. No face mask will resolve all your issues. Rome was not built in a day. Skincare is an everyday habit, consistency is a must. Sometimes breakouts/purging can cause you a lot of anxiety. This can make you go overboard and cause more harm than good. Please be patient with your skin and trust the process.

12. Don’t be too harsh on yourself, dealing with acne can be hard and takes a toll on our mental health. Just remember it doesn’t define you and you can do something about it.

13. With great power comes great responsibility. The ingredients you find people mentioning online that made a difference for them can be really good but if you don’t use them carefully, you might have to deal with more.

14. Skincare is a marathon, not a race. Remember that the efforts you’re putting in will benefit you in long term.

15. Start reading the ingredients list, you’ll eventually know why there is a specific ingredient in there with time. Use https://incidecoder.com/ to read the ingredient label before purchasing a product.

16. Only move to the next product if you’re sure that the current one you’re using doesn’t irritate you.

17. Listen to your skin, not to reviews not to YouTubers. Monitor & observe your skin closely. If some advice is producing negative results even after consistent efforts, no matter how many people claim the advice is working for them, drop it, and vice versa. Learn to observe what causes your skin to react positively/negatively. People are paid to make reviews online if you have a channel on YouTube or they sed products free of cost for them to review (barter) so don’t take reviews too seriously unless you trust the source. (primarily wow and mama earth).

18. NO DIY. Some natural things that are safe to put on your face are honey, aloe vera, tomato masks now and then for brightening(it has vitamin A in it), and you can spot treat pimples with a mixture of turmeric and milk. Don’t overdo any of these either. Also if you use lemon or baking soda or toothpaste on your skin chances are I might visit your home and that would be the last time you’d use them cause you won’t be alive anymore. Seriously though don’t ever use them. They aren’t meant to go on your face.

19. Sleep early ( I can’t seem to do this but it literally changes your skin game), stay hydrated, change pillow covers often, wash your towels, so basically make sure everything that comes into contact with your skin is clean.

20. We are all different. Our skin is not the same. Our environment is not the same. Our genes are not the same. What may be too much for me may be too little for you and, vice-versa. Please patch-test before you try any new product.

21. Skincare YouTubers and Instagrammers: Beauty Within, Liah Yoo, James Welsh, Cassandra Bankson, Hyram, Lab muffin, Samapti Banerjee, Charlotte Palermino, Gothamista, you can trust these people.

Enjoy the process, enjoy taking time for yourself. Happy skincare people.
