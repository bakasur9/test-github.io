I still remember the day 16th august 2016, the day my life turned around. My first day at grad school. It was really hot that day and Delhi is notorious for its extreme climate. Trying to ignore the heat I reached my college with my parents leaving my brother behind at my uncle’s. I was pretty stoked that something big was going to happen in my life. Carrying that same energy, I entered the main gate laying my eyes on the main building far off which kind of looked like those Greek buildings with pillars and a solid central structure. That is a great first Sight I thought.

Then I saw a lot of students trying to figure out their registration process and volunteers from our senior batch were guiding the newcomers. They moved me from one room to another till noon and at last, I managed to get the formalities done, after losing the ability to walk of course. I got to the room I was allocated after lunch. I was pretty fortunate to have had a really great room. The entrance had a passage leading to a hall with a sofa and a coffee table, an oven, and a washing area, and connecting to it were seven Individual rooms. After I dumped my luggage, I met my roommates. Formal introductions exchanged and the day came to an end in a blink.

I was happy till evening that day, that was when parents were supposed to leave the campus. Then all of a sudden it hit me that I’m not going to see them for a long time. Some uneasiness started to brew in my stomach. I felt like someone pushed me into a pit and I could not hit the bottom no matter how deep I fall. My anxiousness grew with every second that passed. I asked my dad if I could stay with them at the hotel with tears rolling down my cheeks and although he thought it was best for me to stay, he couldn’t refuse.

We didn’t spend much time with goodbyes the next day because maybe it was best to rip off the band-aid. My roommates spent the time I spent with my folks socializing, they had already made friends and started exploring nearby places. Seems like I was the only debutant as everybody has had the experience of living away from home and they all adjusted quickly while I was still Homesick.

I remember breaking into tears when I noticed my nails grow and recalling that no one would ask me to trim them now. I stopped listening to music with my earphones as it separated me from the world and I didn’t like that. My roommates, who’d later stay with me till the end of my graduation, helped me get through that stage and I got into the fun part of my life.

I used to sleep on the sofa in the living room with a friend that didn’t sleep mostly cause he was living on a high that a new relationship is. It took me a month or so to get over the uneasiness of being alone, and this was not because I was afraid of something. I would walk into the pitch dark without even thinking twice, I would jump into a 16ft pool without even knowing how to swim that’s how bold I was (or foolish maybe) but I did not understand why the fear of being alone got me so much. I never knew I had this side.

I started appreciating the perks of living away from people that care too much about everything you do. Binge-watching tv series till mornings, waking up at 2 pm, skipping meals, late-night food at Dhaba became the new norm.

Then there was my first vacation. I was really excited to go home. I missed their faces, I missed my brother. Even the 2hr flight journey felt long, well that might have been because of the security checks and baggage check-in but the point is I was kind of impatient to get home. I still remember to date the look on my mother’s face when I got home, she hugged me as soon as she saw me. She didn’t even let me put my bag down. I missed the talks I had with her. Now my mom tells me that I acted weird after coming home, I acted as if I was living in someone else’s home. I knew something was off at that time but I couldn’t tell what it was.

I remember a dialogue of Brad Pitt in the Curious Case of Benjamin button

“It’s a funny thing coming home. Nothing changes. Everything looks the same, feels the same, even smells the same. You realize what’s changed, is you.”

It felt right.

The first time I came home my parents were surprised to see me sleep so much, I was not like that before I left. They thought I just woke up late, little did they know that was because I slept late. I carried that habit from my college. I woke up at noon on the weekends when there wasn’t much stuff to do. They never woke me up but they kept fixating on how I managed to attend classes if I slept how I did.

Sometimes they had some tricks up their sleeve to wake me up. I never woke up when they called out my name. So, they brought their trump card out, “Vada”. There was this place near my home where they used to serve breakfast and boy was their Vada good, I never had Vada anywhere that tasted as good as theirs. They had the white chutney and tomato chutney with sambar and the tomato one was my favorite, the tang it had was no less than the 8th wonder to me. Once I had 18 Vada without even knowing I had 18 Vada.

One morning my mom just said “Sonu dad got Vada from that place” and my mind picked it up on a subconscious level somehow, I was tempted to have breakfast and I woke up. They’ve had their laugh and I had my brekky.

My brother had to put up with my movie and TV series recommendations every time I got home, I used to force him to watch them while all he wanted to do was play video games. I blackmail him that I would not suggest anything ever if he did not watch it so he was left with no other choice. He liked every movie I suggested so he made peace with it eventually.

Every time I came home came a moment where I had to leave them again and there was this uneasiness every single time. it just didn’t get old. Sure the intensity reduced with every visit but it isn’t completely normal to me yet. I always had a movie or a book to snap out of the emotion. They taught me what it meant to miss somebody.

As soon as I reached my college my life was completely different, it was like I had two different lives and two different worlds. Even though I had most of my fun at college I always looked up to visiting home.

Whenever I came home my I could see my mom’s excitement all over her face but my dad always acted pretty coolly about it although he kissed me the next morning when I’m asleep and ran his hand over my head, I woke up sometimes but I acted as if I was still sleeping to not make it awkward. He still kisses me at 21, that kind of embarrasses me sometimes but then again, I feel lucky to have a dad like him.

My brother and I had been showered with love since we were kids, often through action than words. My dad used to take a break from his work to get lunch boxes delivered to us in the afternoon so we could have our food hot, that’s how much they cared about us.

My mom has always kind of been like a sibling to me and my brother. We make fun of each other, we share everything with each other and a part of every chocolate we have goes to her. Dad is a typical dad (with extra sarcasm and charm), providing everything that he didn’t have in extra, putting our happiness before his.

When I was in college, I missed the arguments my mom and dad had, while my brother and I just sat there laughing. I missed the food I had at home. I missed the variety I had at home. Back at Uni it was pretty much the same few dishes repeated every week.

Once my mom asked me what I wanted to have when I come home and I asked for Fried potatoes and Palak Dal. She cracked up because I asked for something that simple. For her it was simple but for me, it’s something that I missed the most. She made really good fried potatoes, they were crunchy on the outside and mushy on the inside and she almost never missed that consistency. She washes the potatoes thoroughly with water before frying them to remove all the starch possible and this is what that makes the difference (pro tip). She knew that because she cares when she is cooking for us (although it’s not her favorite thing to do).

I know everyone says their mom cooks the best food but I’d say nobody can compare to my mom. Up until grade XII, my desk during lunch looked like I stole everybody’s lunch box lids and was planning to take down every teacher in the building with them. Everybody wanted a part of my lunch, which obviously suggests that I am lucky to have the food I have.

I used to get all the things I wanted to eat when I’m home. My dad used to get boxes of Kaju Katli every single time and not once it lasted more than a day. I always had food like I was starving back at college.

I became the family driver as soon as I got home (not complaining) and my dad was happy. My mom has got an extra person to talk to so she was happy. I had to (was forced to actually) run errands whenever I came home so my brother was happy, I got my food and peace so I was happy too. It was always a happy thing coming home.

I did not appreciate the time we spent together before I went out as much as I do now. I guess you only start to appreciate something when you know how it feels not having it.

It is always hard to call home daily and talk to them every day when you are away for work or school or something else because you’ll have a lot going in your life that wasn’t there before. So, I made sure to have fun and be there every time I got home and I’m glad that I got to experience two ends of a broad spectrum.
